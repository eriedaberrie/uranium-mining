Everyone's favorite radioactive metal!

This repository contains some artifacts of me getting data from Pokemon Uranium
1.3.1 and reformatting it into whatever I need for Pokemon Showdown, for that
Coming Soon^TM Uranium Showdown rewrite.

This repository contains no actual game assets; the extracted game should be
manually placed in a top-level ~game~ directory, with some tweaks (lowercase all
the image extensions, decrypt the rgssad, etc.).  ~pbs~ contains some select game
data, everything else is licensed under GPLv3.
